Quick Swap is a pretty neat mod that removes the cooldown and lock while and after using items, making it possible to quickly swap between items on the hotbar.

Beware: This mod uses IL editing. It may not work perfectly with all mods, and might have introduced a bunch of unforseen bugs.

I have personally verified that it works with CalamityMod and several other mods.
